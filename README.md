# PlanitRight

Create a Schedule Planning website that contains a calendar, a clock and a list
of tasks to be completed. The Website should allow the users to store different
tasks on any day selected in the calendar. In addition, all the tasks should be
stored in the user's computer even after the Web Browser is closed.
